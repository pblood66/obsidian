# Peter & John
How to we go from a Disciple -> Witness -> Saint

**Saint (Qodeshin)**: One who is *becoming* holy 
- someone who takes their discipleship and develops a testimony and becomes holy

How do we go from a small congregation -> Kingdom
How do we go from Persecuted -> Peacemakers
How do we go from Convert -> Converted 

You become doers of the word not just hearers
Acting upon the things that you have learned

John the Beloved was the only apostle that stayed with Jesus through the trials and the scourging in the temple. 
- He knew the High priest who spat on Jesus and the High Priest knows John.
