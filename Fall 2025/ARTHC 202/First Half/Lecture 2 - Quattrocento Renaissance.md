# The Renaissance 
We can use the things that people have made to use as historical documents
- We communicate things through things like the clothes we wear, cars we drive, among other things
The 1500's is the high of the Renaissance 

## Approaching the Renaissance
- Renaissance means rebirth
	- Roman and Greek culture was a certain high point in culture and thinking
	- In between was the dark ages
	- The Renaissance was the rebirth of classical Greek and Rome 
- The name of the Renaissance fails to recognize that things have changed a lot since the fall of Rome 
- Not all of the changes in the Medieval times was bad
	- Things are in constant progression
- Rebirth makes it seem like a sudden rupture into the ether
	- In reality the world was constantly changing since the Romans which led to the Renaissance
