# Photography
**Pinhole camera**
- *Camera Obscura*
- Camera obscura gets used as a sketching tool
	- back in the 1600s
- people are playing around with chemicals that are photosensitive
	- They don't know how to stop the process yet

#### Joseph Nicephore Niepce, View from the Window at Le Gras, 1826
- Used a metal sheet to capture the image
- Used several chemical washes to stop the darkening
- Took about a day to expose
	- cool, not really useful
- Not completely fixed
#### Louis Daguerre, Boulevard du Temple, 1838
- Worked with Niepce
- Created his own process
	- Found a way to make a detailed, fixed image
		- super super detailed
		- fragile
	- on a piece of metal
	- Only one image 
- *Viewed it as science*
- **daguerreotype** photos
- First person ever photographed
- Took 15-20 minutes to expose
#### Henry Fox Talbot, Latticed Window, 1835
- **Talbotype** process

# Modernism
**What is it?**
- Mid 19th Century
- Modernism doesn't mean something recent
- *A doctrine, theory, and a way of creating art that has a relation to the current*
- heightened awareness of the ever changing present 
- A feeling that traditional mechanisms for producing art are not suited to the current living reality of art producers and consumers and shouldn't be culturally enforced simply because they are long-established
**It is not**:
- a unified style or fixed time-period
### The Long 19th Century
1780-1920-ish 
- The world flip flops
	- turns upside down
- American and French Revolutions
- Industrial revolution
- American Civil War
- Napoleonic Reign
- Major dev. germ theory
- table of elements
- vaccines
- steam locomotives
**Communist Manifesto** - Karl Marx
**On The Origin of Species** - Charles Darwin
- Things are happening at break neck speed

This leads artists to want to paint different than their forefathers
Things are changing in the world so much and so does the art world
Not constrained  by tradition

Schools of Art - Government funded bureaucracies that determine what is good and bad art 
- artists start rebelling against this idea

***Modernism** is self-conscious in appraising and critiquing inherited traditions, so that each modernist may create revised and/or new processes for engaging with their experience of the present*
