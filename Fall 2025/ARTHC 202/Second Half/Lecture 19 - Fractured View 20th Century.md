# Cubism
#### Georges Braque, The Portuguese, 1911
- Picasso and Braque open the doors to cubism to the public
- Portuguese man playing the guitar next to a river
- Fractured view
	- *Analytic cubism* - start with something you see in the real world, using your eyes analyze the geometric pattern, break it down into its geometric shapes, move around the shapes
		- Goal is to make something new not a representation of it 
		- Not look exactly like a guy that plays the guitar
		- the painting is a painting
- breaking up the figure and the ground
	- figure-ground relationship: differentiate the figure from the ground
	- For cubists, the ground also gets broken into shapes
- **compressed palette and lots of right angles**

#### Picasso, Still Life with Chair Cane, 1912
- Looking down at a glass topped table at a cafe
- interested in questioning illusion
#### Picasso, Guitar, 1913
- originally supposed to be a maquette
	- a model for a larger sculpture of a guitar
- liked it as it is
- made from cardboard
	- wants to question what makes art art?
	- it's not like other materials are particularly special
	- We're the ones that make the rules
#### Picasso, Three Musicians, 1921
- *Synthetic Cubism* - start with colors and shapes, the colors and shapes move into things that look like things, 
	- synthesize -> build up something
- Introduces bright colors
## The Futurists

- Trying to represent something moving through space and time
- *The futurists*

- Hanging out in Italy
#### Umberto Boccioni, Unique Forms of Continuity in Space, 1913
- space moving around a figure
- Writing futurists manifesto
	- greatest work of art man has made is war
		- cleanses the earth
	- They hang out with peeps like Mussolini
	- Futurists were proto fascists
- Can/should we separate the art from the artist?
	- it's not cut and dry
	- Picasso was a bad person but he still played an integral role in art history
	- We can love something but also feel really complicated about
		- art gives us a safe place to interact with things like that
