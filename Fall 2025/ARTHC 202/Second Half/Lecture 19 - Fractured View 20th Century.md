- Picasso didn't just paint abstract paintings
- He did highly illusionistic and academic paintings
	- He just wasn't "in" to it
- Super talented artist that got bored of it 
	- became an artistic sponge
#### Picasso, Old Guitarist, 1905

	- Picasso in an expressionist mode
	- blue
	- art is pretty melancholy
- exaggeration and elongation of a man
#### Picasso, Family of Saltimbanques, 1905
- Rose period
	- uses colors in a rose
	- Emotionally ambiguous paintings
#### Picasso, Les Demoisselles D'Avignon, 1907
- not a truly cubist work
- transitional piece
- adaptation of the rose period
- Still in an expressionist mode 
- Saw the paintings of Cezanne
	- flattened landscapes
# Cubism
#### Georges Braque, The Portuguese, 1911
- Picasso and Braque open the doors to cubism to the public
- Portuguese man playing the guitar next to a river
- Fractured view
	- *Analytic cubism* - start with something you see in the real world, using your eyes analyze the geometric pattern, break it down into its geometric shapes, move around the shapes
		- Goal is to make something new not a representation of it 
		- Not look exactly like a guy that plays the guitar
		- the painting is a painting
- breaking up the figure and the ground
	- figure-ground relationship: differentiate the figure from the ground
	- For cubists, the ground also gets broken into shapes
- **compressed palette and lots of right angles**

#### Picasso, Still Life with Chair Cane, 1912
- Looking down at a glass topped table at a cafe
- interested in questioning illusion
#### Picasso, Guitar, 1913
- originally supposed to be a maquette
	- a model for a larger sculpture of a guitar
- liked it as it is
- made from cardboard
	- wants to question what makes art art?
	- it's not like other materials are particularly special
	- We're the ones that make the rules
#### Picasso, Three Musicians, 1921
- *Synthetic Cubism* - start with colors and shapes, the colors and shapes move into things that look like things, 
	- synthesize -> build up something
- Introduces bright colors
