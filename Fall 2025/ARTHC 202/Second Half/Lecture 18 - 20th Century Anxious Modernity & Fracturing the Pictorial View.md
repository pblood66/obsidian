# 20th Century Art
- Reacting the works of the 19th century
- Artists choosing to use color not as imitative work
## Expressionists
### The French Fauves
#### Andre Derain, London Bridge, 1906
- Artists called the *Wild Beasts* - *fauves*
- intense colors
- relationship between the colors
	- river wasn't green and the sky wasn't pink
	- the fauves don't care about that
		- interested in created new compositions and color combinations
	- not related to the color of the real world object
- sense of new and evolving world
- seeking something joyous

#### Henri Matisse, The Red Room, 1907
- saturated red
- makes it look flat
- simplified characters
- abandoned the sense of depth and space compared to *The Dinner Table*
- using arbitrary color
	- when he selects color, at first they are arbitrary, then he uses them to create visual harmony
		- musician hitting random keys and then using those as the harmony

##### Matisse, The Dinner Table, 1896-97
- Was turned down because they deemed it too controversial
	- looked too sketchy
- basically the same as the red room
#### Matisse, The Dance, 1910
- super simplified figures
	- describing the bodies in as few of lines as possible
- composition comes from the Joy of Life
- Comes from the color
##### Matisse, The Joy of Life, 1906
- people just sitting out in the park enjoying themselves
### The German Expressionists
- artists band together and becomes super partisan
	1. *The Bridge*
		- Art bridge to the future
		- 
	2. The Blue Rider
### The Bridge
#### Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Dresden Street Scene, 1907
- Kirchner was an architecture student. But not trained as an artist
	- We should showcase the art of people that are never represented
- **The Bridge**
	- They want their art to be a bridge to the future
- Depressing
- Figures almost look like zombies. 
	- faces look sickly or diseased
- Did not view Dresden in a positive light
- Scary looking child
- View of the modern world that's far less optimistic
	- for most people, modernism is tied to a sense of utopia
	- Others, things are moving so fast, that we don't know what tomorrow will look like
- Kirchner definitely was the latter
#### Emil Nolde, The Last Supper, 1909
- Crowded space
- Nolde is representing the feelings of the apostles in hiding during the last supper
#### Nolde, Still Life (Masks III), 1911
- Finding sources of art from non-traditional places
- purely looking at them for their physical 
	- not caring about who made them, what they were used for, etc
- Creating something that is new and different and has a powerful affect on the viewer
### The Blue Rider
#### Wassily Kandinsky, Impression III (Concert), 1911
- inspired by the works of Van Gogh
- pushing further into abstraction
- Kandinsky had synesthesia
	- could see music
- painted the visual experience that he had of yellow light pouring from the piano
	- encouraged him to lean into the abstract form of art
#### Kandinsky, Improvisation 29, 1912
- abstract but still taking things from the world
- believes that colors vibrate on spiritual wavelength
- Really liked blue -> The Blue Rider
#### Franz Marc, Blue Horses, 1911
- Marc basically gave up on humans
	- people are the worst -> only paints animals
- Bodies of the horses are mimicked in the shape of the hills in the background
	- animals are more closely connected to nature
	- humans are an antagonist of nature
#### Marc, Fate of the Animals, 1913
- Everything is in chaos
	- sharp diagonals are cutting and severing instead of connecting and harmonizing
- wrote "Und Alles Sein Ist flammend Leid"
	- and all being is flaming agony
- Right before the outbreak of WWI
	- Europe is just increasing in tension until it snaps
- Sense of disunity and discord in the air of Europe
## Expressionism in other Mediums
#### Kirchner, Mary Wigman, 1933
- Expressionism in wood block prints
- Mary Wigman is an expressionist dancer
#### Mary Wigman, Hexentanz, 1914 (expressionist dance)
- The witch's dance
- unsettling
	- meant to freak you out and to look witchy
- would have been incredibly weird and unsettling during that time
	- that's the point
#### F.W. Murnau, Nosferatu, 1922 (Expressionist Film)
- oldest existing film telling the story of dracula
-
