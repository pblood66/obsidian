In our eternal experience, we were sent to this Earth to experience joy. The prophet Lehi describes our purpose as, "Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy. Additionally, President Nelson builds on this, explaining that our joy can be increased as we focus on the Savior Jesus Christ throughout our daily lives. President Monson also discusses that our Heavenly Father will pour out joy and heavenly blessings to us and our families. These sources show that we were divinely destined to experience joy through the loving support of Heavenly Parents and a Savior.
