## Draft
### Problem Solver
**Problem**: When I first started working as an IT specialist a research student came in with a very unique and specific problem with Linux, however, at the time I knew very little about Linux.
**Action**: One of my responsibilities as a computer specialist is that I am needed to learn new technologies often on the fly. I spent most of the day reading documentation and troubleshooting.  
**Result**: Even though I couldn't see the solution to the problem, I trusted that I had the skills and abilities to find it. As a result, I learned basic shell scripting
