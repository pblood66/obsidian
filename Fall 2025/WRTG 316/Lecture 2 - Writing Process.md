Describe your writing process
- Typically it takes me a long time to write. I have to sit and think about how I'm going to word something or how I want to express an idea. Typically once I have an idea of how I want to structure something I can kinda word vomit for a paragraph or two and then I have to sit back and think again.

The writing process is often a lot messier than you think

- get your hands on multiple successful resumes in your field

4 Parts to the writing process
- Plan
- Practice
- Revise
- Reflect

# Plan
Skilled writers take considerably more time planning their writing
When we plan, we 
1. assess the task
2. set goals

## Assessing
1. read the assignment carefully
2. assess the rhetorical situation
3. analyze the genre
4. review how prior knowledge or experience might apply
5. assess ability to perform the task
6. decide what we want to get out of the assignment
## Set Goal
1. specific product goals (what you want your writing to look like when it's done)
2. self regulating goals (how you're going to do it)
	- environmental (when and where you're going to write)
	- personal (checking your progress + rewards)
	- social (talking, peer review, writing center=writing is social)
# Practice
1. Invent
2. Draft
3. Feedback
## Invent
Invention = brainstorming
- clustering 
- listing
- free writing
- outlining
## Drafting
Drafting = writing
Draft drunk 
- Audience 
- Genre
- Divide a big task into smaller tasks
- Drafting as drafting (when you write it's not set in stone. Discover what you want to say)
- ignore sentence-level issues
## Feedback
**Be specific** with what you want to receive
- Give your work to someone you trust
- Tell them what you are trying to accomplish
- Give a brief self-assessment of your draft
- Give specific tasks to your reader
- And just chill

# How do I want to try changing my writing process
- Listen to music with lyrics
- Draft drunk
- Don't worry about the red squiggly line
- Try clustering to practice and to organize my ideas
- Set rewards for finishing sections/projects
- Draft in a quiet & peaceful space

# Resumes
 Create a master resume 
 - include everything you have done. 
 - As you go through work/internship add it to your master resume
## Visual Hierarchy
Upper left corner is given priority
- Heading
- Education
- Work Experience
- Skills
- Awards and Achievements
- **Interests**
- Chronological or Functional/Skills
## Bulleted Sections
- task oriented
- verb first phrases
- add numbers and data
- shows impact on others
- motivation
White space does damage on Resumes

- Adapt to audience
- Highlight most relevant bullet points
- 2-4 bullets per entry/experience
- cut out irrelevant bullet points
	- High School (Don't include unless it's amazing)

### Action-Verb First/Parallel Structure
Verbs first and all should be the same tense (all past tense or all present tense)

- The resume needs to be perfect (**NO ERRORS**)
