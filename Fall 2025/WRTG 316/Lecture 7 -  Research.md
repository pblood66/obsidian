- When I'm doing research I generally first go to wikipedia to gain a baseline knowledge of what I need to know
- Sometimes I'll read the sources in the wikipedia article
- Usually I'll go to google scholar to look up academic articles
- I've used refworks in the past to look at other academic articles available to BYU.

**Add to PJR**
When I'm reading my articles for research I'm going to focus on skimming the article
- Taking the article on a date 
If I find a suitable article I want to focus on planning how I'll read it.
- Develop questions to answer while reading. 
Take Notes while I'm reading the article.
I want to summarize key points in my own words in the moment.
- No Copy/Pasting sections into my notes sections
- Taking note of where those sections are in the article as well
During this project I want to spend at least 2-3 hours before the library day to research my topic
