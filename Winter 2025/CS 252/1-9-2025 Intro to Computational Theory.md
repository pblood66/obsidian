# Finite State Automata
Finite State Automata - No memory and finite number of states
  $$L = \{0^{k}1^{n}|k,n \ge 0\}$$

# Push Down Automata 
$$L = \{0^{k}1^{k}|k\ge0\}$$
Acceptable Strings: 01, 0011, 000111...
- Requires memory to keep track of number 1's and 0's

# Decidability Theory 
What can be computed, i.e. decided, by models 
- you can develop an algorithm 
	- gives a yes or no answer
> Will I be rich tomorrow? 

- You can never be certain. Never a 100% yes or no
# Complexity Theory
Resources required so that problems can be computed
