# Questions to Consider
- What is the Atonement?
- How does the Atonement overcome the effects of the Fall?
- What new knowledge can Latter-day Saints teach the world about the Atonement? 
It is incomplete to say "I was saved by the atonement" or that "the atonement gave me strength" - Russell Nelson
- The atonement was an event
- Jesus Christ and Heavenly Father are the source where all the blessings and strength of the atonement come from
It's not the atonement that saves us, it's Jesus Christ. 
Repentance is a process - We can know that we have repented if we have become changed by Christ 
- Not a black and white, do this, do that process
- not a checklist
