*Gospel Doctrines* are *eternal*, *do not change*, and *pertain to our eternal progression* and exaltation.
- The core doctrines of the Gospel of Jesus Christ are relatively small
*Supporting Teachings* are explanatory of core doctrines.

- They are based in core doctrines and come through revelation.
*Esoteric Teachings* that might not yet be fully explained to us, or that requires further revelation to fully understand.
