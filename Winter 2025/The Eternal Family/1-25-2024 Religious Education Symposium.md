- Elizabeth Allred - helped create the first garment
	- Unbleached muslin
	- Tie strings
	- No collars
## The Revealed Pattern

	- Joseph tried to follow the "exact pattern" the best he could
- In 1923 the garment changed
	- Material
	- Length
	- No collar
	- buttons instead of tie strings
- The marks must not be changed 
- The Garment has changed not just in this dispensation but throughout history
	1. Adam and Eve - animal skins
	2. Priests of the mosaic tabernacle
	3. Jesus Christ
	4. Joseph Smith
## Why did Moroni reveal a pattern?
- Joseph was flexible with the original garment
### The Kirtland Temple
Only gave two instructions 
1. 55 feet wide by 65 feet long
2. An upper and lower Court
3. D&C 94:4-5
God wanted the saints to use their agency and be creative
### What Hasn't Changed?
- The covenant/relationship
- Protection 
- Sacred symbols
- The form was never the pattern 
The garment  represents the celestial glory
- Moroni is thought to not be wearing the garment in his initial appearance to Joseph
- Moroni then dawns the garment to instruct Joseph
