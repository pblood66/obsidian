# What Kind of Being is God?
"If men do not comprehend the character of God, they do not comprehend themselves" 

Three things are necessary in order that any rational intelligent being may exercise faith in God unto life and salvation.
1. The idea that he actually **exists**.
2. Correct idea of **his character, perfections, and attributes**
3. An actual knowledge that the course of life which one is pursuing is **according** to his will.
