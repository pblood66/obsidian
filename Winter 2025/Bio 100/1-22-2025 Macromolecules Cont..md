# Lipids
- Phospholipids: Hydrophobic "tails" and hydrophilic "heads" = cell membranes
- steroids
- Cholesterol: good (HDL - high density lipid) and bad (LDL - low density lipid)
- Hormones: Estrogen vs Testosterone 
	- One hydroxyl substituted for ketone
	- addition of a methyl
	- NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE
# Proteins
- Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen
- amino acid is the building block
	- Only 20 naturally occurring
- **denaturation**: chemically or thermally breaking protein bonds
## Protein Structure
- Primary: order of amino acids
- Secondary: Folding, bending, or pleating
- Tertiary: Hydrogen and disulfide bonds
- Quaternary: Globular=hemoglobin, strands=collagen
# Nucleotides/Nucleic Acids
- Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus
- nucleotide is building block of nucleic acid
- ATP = adenosine triphosphate is a nucleotide 
	- Energy carrier
- DNA and RNA are nucleic acids
	- different sugar groups + nucleotides
	- same nitrogenous basess
## DNA 
- Deoxyribonucleic acid
- Nucleotides: **G**uanine, **A**denine, **C**ytosine, and **T**hymine
	- Guanine and Cytosine always bond
	- Adenine and Thymine always bond
## RNA 
- Ribonucleic acid
- Nucleotides: **G**uanine, **A**denine, **C**ytosine, and **U**racil
	- Guanine always bonds to cytosine
	- Adenine always bonds to uracil
