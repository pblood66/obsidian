## Mitochondria cont.
- Mitochondria also have their own DNA from mother's side
	- Mitochondrial "eve"
	- theory of mitochondria as descendent of an independent bacteria as a symbiont 
# Plant Cells
- *cell wall* 
- *chloroplasts* contain chlorophyll where photosynthesis occurs 
- *plastids* act in seasonal food storage and contains seasonal pigments 
- *central vacuole* acts as a water pump, hazmat site, food storage, and pigment reserve 
# Cell Membranes
## Functions
- separate in from out = dynamic, fluid barrier
- regulates materials into & out of cell = diffusion, active transport
- senses changes in external environment
	- particularly changes in pH
- cell to cell communication = type 
- maintain structure & chemical reactions
- protection, movement, secretion, and some transport 
## Structure
- bilayer of phospholipids
- the tails are bent 
- not bonded together
- polar "head"
- 2 non-polar "tails"
	- double bond makes it kink
	- unsaturated lipids
		- not solid at room temperature
## Membrane Proteins
- **Receptor Protein**: Some molecule fits into protein, then causes a response inside the cell
-  **Recognition Protein**: cellular I.D. tags, self from not self (blood, transplants)
- **Enzymes**: proteins that help chemical reactions (amylase) 
- **Attachment proteins**: Holds cytoskeleton to membrane and attach cells together
- **Transport Proteins**: regulate movement of molecules across the membrane
	- channel: $H_{2}O$ or ions pass through
		- passive, always open; like a straw
	- carrier: lock and key with molecules, change shape, then release to other side
		- active, expensive, 
# Diffusion
- from area of high concentration to area of low concentration 
- greater concentration = faster diffusion 
- increased temp. = faster diffusion 
- increased pressure = faster diffusion
- continues until equalization
- requires no energy (ATP)
