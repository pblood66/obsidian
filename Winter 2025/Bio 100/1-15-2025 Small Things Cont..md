# Water
- Takes a lot of energy to heat up
	- More than most substances
	- Human body can resist overheating for a relatively long time because of the water content
- Takes a lot of energy to evaporate
	- Hydrogen bonds in sweat break and release heat, therefore organism cools down
- Solid water expands 
	- **Frostbite**: freezing of water inside cells and the ice crystals puncture membrane
		- Cell death
		- Leads to tissue death
	- Certain organisms with antifreeze proteins 
		- Cover the sharp edges of ice crystals
# Macromolecules 
We live on a carbon based planet
- Life is based on Carbon
## Carbon 
- Capable of bonding 4 times to something else 
	- 4 single bonds
	- 2 single and 1 double bond
	- 1 single and 1 triple bond
	- 2 double bonds
- Forms long chain-like backbone or ring
- **Monomer**: single subunits
- Polymer: long chains of monomers
- Highly unstable; therefore highly reactive
- Highly attractive to organic (carbon/hydrogen) molecules
## Dehydration Synthesis
- Organic molecules joined by removing water 
- Happens in solution

# Hydrolysis 
- Breaking a big molecule by adding water
- Happens in solution

# The 4 Macromolecules
1. Carbohydrates
2. Proteins
3. Lipids
4. Nucleic Acids 
## Carbohydrates
- Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen
- Simple sugar (glucose) to complex (starch)
- **Monosaccharide**: One sugar molecule
	- *Glucose*
	- *Fructose*
	- *Galactose*
	- *Ribose*
- Polysaccharide = many sugar molecules bonded together
	- Starch in plants
	- Glycogen in animals
	- Cellulose in plant structure; non digestible in humans (fiber)
	- Chitin in exoskeleton of arthropods
## Lipids
- Carbon hydrogen, oxygen 
- Hydrophobic; insoluble in water
- Stores energy, waxy coverings, membranes
- Fats: more energy storage than sugars, but weigh less
	- **Saturated**: maximum number of single hydrogen bonds
	- **Unsaturated**: at least one (probably more) double bonds = oils
