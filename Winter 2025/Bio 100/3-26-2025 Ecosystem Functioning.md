# Solar Energy
- small amount reaches Earth
- most reflected by atmosphere
- most is absorbed as heat
- tiny amount captured for photosynthesis; this supports all life on the planet
- solar energy -> chemical energy (sugars, etc.)
## Trophic Levels
- **autotrophs**: produce their own food supply
	- producers
	- photo synthesizers
	- plants
- **heterotrophs**: consume energy from others
	- primary: herbivores that consume autotrophs
	- secondary: carnivores that consume primary
	- tertiary: carnivores that consume secondary 
	- and so on and soo on
- What if any are the predicting factors? 
	- g biomass/sq. meter/year
- **Detritus Feeders**: feed on waste & the dead
	- can be producers, consumers, primary or secondary heterotrophs
- **Decomposers**: secrete enzymes outside, then absorb nutrients
	- mostly fungi and bacteria 
# Food Chains 
- linear: not very informative
# Food Web
- interconnecting food chains
- allows for omnivores 
- more complicated 
# Inefficiencies
- most energy is lost as heat (2nd Law of Thermodynamics)
- Some energy used by individual species
- energy transfer is reduced moving through the food chain and food web 
## Rule of 10
- only ~10% passes to next level
- therefore, ~90% loss at trophic level
# Nutrient Cycling
- some are required in very large quantities
	- oxygen, carbon, glucose
- some are required in small quantities
	- zinc, phosphorous
- reservoirs: storage sites for these nutrients
## Water Cycle 
- essential for life - < 70% living biomass
- movement of water through ecosystems
	- transports other essential minerals/nutrients
	- Head/cold sink
- Will still continue with/without life on Earth
	- 2.24 kJ AA battery to evaporate 1 g water 
	- 1/3 of total input of solar energy
## Nitrogen Cycle
- abundant on planet, but short supply in biological communities
- Most organisms cannot break the triple bond
- nitrogen fixers: only species capable of using nitrogen and producing ammonia - bacteria
- symbiotic relationship with legumes
