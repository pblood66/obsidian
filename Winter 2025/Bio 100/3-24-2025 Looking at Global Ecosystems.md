# What is an Ecosystem?
- everything living and non-living within a geographical boundary
- species, populations, community + climate, weather, topography, geology, chemistry
- large-scale processes 
- all interacting to produce an ecosystem
## Ecosystem Predictors
- Climate: long-term weather patterns of a region
	- temperate, dry climate of Utah
	- warm, humid climate of Florida
	- influenced by relationship of the sun and Earth
- Planetary Characteristics
	- tilt of Earth is responsible for seasons
- Rotation effects
	- planetary air currents produce predictable climates
	- planetary water currents produce predictable marine climates
- Land Topography
	- air rises up and over mountains
	- precipitation on leading side, less on "shadow" side 
# Biodiversity Patterns and Climate
- Species distribution:
	- dependent on temperature and water availability
	- not the same everywhere
	- **Biomes**: characteristic conditions and plant communities
- Tropical Rain Forests
	- equatorial, relatively warm constant temps, large amount of rainfall
	- Most biodiversity on planet (maybe 1/2)
	- most nutrients are stored in vegetation
		- cut down and burn vegetation, soil is mostly infertile
		- many attempts at large-scale agriculture have failed 
- Tropical Deciduous Forests
	- intermittent rainfall, wet/dry seasons
	- parts of Florida and extreme Southeast ("swamp")
- Tropical Scrub/Savanna
	- little rainfall, still have monsoons
	- intermittent trees, mostly grasses
- Deserts
	- almost no rainfall (arbitrarily less than 10 in/yr)
	- can be very hot, can be very cold
	- amazing adaptations 
- Chapparal
	- all of the little rainfall comes in cool winters
	- mostly shrubs
- Grasslands
	- tall and short-grass prairie
	- continuous grass cover
- Temperate Deciduous Forests: 
	- sub-freezing winters 
	- enough rainfall to support trees
- Temperate Rain Forests
	- coastal regions, very moist
	- moderate temps. around 50 in rain/yr
- Taiga
	- Northern coniferous
	- short growing season, precip. is mostly snow
- Tundra
	- treeless, extremely short growing season, harsh winters, low rainfall
	- permafrost prevents water absorption 
- Freshwater zones
	- littoral: shoreline, abundant light
	- limnetic: mid water column, stll photosynthetic
	- profundal: no photosynthesis, survive on material that sinks down from above
	- Two types of lakes based on nutrients
		- oligotrophic: low nutrient, cold, clear
		- eutrophic: high nutrient, warmer, low oxygen 
- Marine (saltwater) ecosystems:
	- estuaries: unstable mix of salt and fresh water, tidal changes, river and ocean meet
	- intertidal: 
		- tide pools
		- species must tolerate dry and wet conditions
	- continental shelf
	- coral reefs
	- open ocean
	- benthic: deep water
		- super oxygenated water in colder oceans allows for larger than average invertebrates
