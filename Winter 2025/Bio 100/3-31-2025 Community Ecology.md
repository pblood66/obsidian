# Community 
- all populations that interact within a geographical area (ecosystem)
	- swamp 
	- coral reef

## Community Interactions
- Competition: lose-lose (-, -)
- Predation: lose, win (-, +)
- Parasitism: lose, win (-, +)
- Mutualism/Symbiosis: win, win (+, +)

Ecological Niche: everything a species does or encounters in a habitat
- eats, nutrients
- physical residence
- conditions
- reproduction activities
- etc. 

- Competition is greatest with greater niche overlap
	- one species can outcompete the other to extinction
	- competitive exclusion

## How to Avoid this?
- adapt to reduce overlap and exclusion
- resource partitioning:
	- reduce competition by partitioning out or using different parts of a resource
## If Competition isn't avoided
- both populations are restricted
# Predator/Prey
predators and prey can act as a selection pressure on each other
develops adaptations in response to the other 
- counter-measures: a war of attrition 
-  camouflage
- bright colors: warning
- Aggressive mimicry: some method of attracting prey
- Chemical warfare
- parasitism
- mutualism
