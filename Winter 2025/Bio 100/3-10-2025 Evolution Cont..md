## Comparative Anatomy:
- Compare forelimbs of all vertebrates
- organisms from different ancestries having same forms/structures in same environments
- whales and snakes still have pelvic girdles
## Embryology
- ontology (study of how things develop) recapitulates phylogeny (how things are related)
- Etienne Serres
- looks at stages of embryo development to clue in on evolutionary changes in a particular species
## Geographic Distribution
- marsupials & placentals
- two "ideal" forms
- two groups separated by geography
- "descent with modification through natural selection"
## Progression of Fossil forms
- the shallower the fossil, the more it looks like the present form
	- horses
# Neo-Darwinian Synthesis
- reconciled natural selection with Mendelism
- Mendel "re-discovered" in 1901-1903
- Inheritance is not blended, but particulate
- differential proliferation of phenotypes 
- natural selection could change gene frequencies
- more successful genotype = more successful offspring 
# Population Genetics
## Important Terms
- **Population**: all individuals of same species living in a given geographical area
- **gene**: discreet segment of DNA that codes for a particular trait
- **gene pool**: all the genes of a population
- **Allele Frequency**: relative proportion of each allele in the population
	- Key: Evolution is change of allele frequencies within a population over time/generations
	- define when there's no evolution
		- Hardy-Weinberg Principle: allele frequencies and genotype frequencies remain unchanged
			- NO EVOLUTION
			- **conditions**
				- no mutations
				- no gene flow
					- no immigration
					- no emigration
				- very large population
					- reduces the influence of outliers
				- completely random mating
				- no natural selection: no differential fitness
## Harvey-Weinberg Principle
- mutations are the source of variation
	- extremely rare
	- can accumulate over long, long periods of time
	- random chance; whether helpful or harmful
- gene flow: movement of alleles to/from another population 
	- rampant in modern humans
	- plant populations too 
	- what if the population is not large
		- genetic drift: some random event that removes some alleles from a small population
			- bottleneck: population decreases due to an event resulting in allele decrease
				- Cheetahs - poaching
			- Founder effect: small portion of population "founds" new area
				- starling birds
- Completely random mating: 
	- just doesn't happen
- All genotypes are equally successful
	- some, but not all
	- any trait that gives any kind of advantage will increased success (survival and reproduction)
# Natural Selection at Work
- "Survival of the fittest" - Herbert Spencer
- Natural selection favors traits that increase success
	- success = survival and reproduction
- Acts on phenotypes, but phenotypes and genotypes are closely linked
