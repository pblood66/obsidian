## Speciation Depends on Two Things
- population isolation: prevents gene flow between two groups
- Genetic Divergence: development of large genetic differences
	- by chance = genetic drift
	- natural selection = different environmental pressures 
## Ways to Separate
- **Allopatric Speciation:** Two populations are geographically separated
	- invasion of new habitat
	- habitat division: geographic, climate, or landscape change separates populations 
	- natural selection and genetic drift further isolates population
- **Sympatric Speciation**: Population isolation without geographic separation
		- ecological niche differences separate and stop gene flow
- **Mutation**: rare, but can lead to instant speciation
# Systematics
## Biological Classification
- **Taxonomy**: Naming organisms
	- 2 part name: *Genus species* (*Homo sapiens*, *Felis concolor*)
	- **phylogeny**: classification based on evolutionary history
	- **systematics**: discovering those evolutionary relationships
	- **clade**: "family tree of groups of organisms"
- Hierarchical: 
	- **domain**: Eukarya (enclosed nucleus)
	- **Kingdom**: plantae (chloroplasts)
	- **Phylum**: Echinodermata (spiny skin)
	- **Class**: Aves, Reptilia (scales (feathers are modified scales)) 
	- **Order**: Lepidoptera 
	- **Family**: Gekkonidae
	- **Genus**: *Sceloporus*
	- **Species**: *sapiens*
## How do we decide?
- **homologous structures**: Similar structures show similar evolutionary history
	- even when similar structures have different functions (wings, flippers, and legs)
	- forelimbs of bird and mammals
- **vestigial structures**: maintaining structures that don't serve any purpose
	- Snakes and whales have pelvises
- Watch out for convergent evolution and analogous structures
	- **convergent evolution**: anatomical similarities not derived from common ancestry (anti freeze proteins)
	- **analogous structures**: structures with similar functions, but dissimilar anatomy
		- bird wings, grasshopper wings, and sting ray "wings"
		- not derived from common ancestry but similar environment
## Evolutionary Biology
- Reconstructing evolutionary trees and classification
### The BIG picture
- we don't have direct measure of evolutionary history, so we must reconstruct
- classification based on phylogeny is powerful 
## Classification Types
- **Trivial classification**: An organizing system of convenience which does not reflect anything beyond the criterion used for classification. Using one criteria to order things
	- Stamp, coin collections, classifying organism by colors shapes, sizes, etc. 
- **Non-trivial Classification**: An organizing system which reflects something in addition to the criterion on which it was organized
	- Periodic table of the elements
		- Based on proton & electron number; **predictive**
- Species can be arranged into sets of nested hierarchies
