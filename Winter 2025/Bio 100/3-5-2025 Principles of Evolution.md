# History of Evolutionary Thought
- Biology pre-18th century
	- single system of thought
## Three cornerstones:
1. fixity of species: organisms will stay the same
2. hierarchical organization: system of sorting other biological organisms
3. natural theology: our motivation is to come closer to God

- Fixity of Species: 
	- Working scientific theory
	- empirical evidence and philosophical ideas
	- discrete boundaries between species 
	- species did not change over the history of the world 
	- **No Extinction**
- Hierarchical Organization of Species
	- species fall into natural groups (genus, family class, etc.)
	- first mentioned by Aristotle 
		- God > Angels > Demons > Man > Woman > Animals > Plants > Minerals
- Natural Theology
	- All Creation due to activities of Christian God
	- discovering Nature = discovering God
### Problems with Cornerstones
- variability within species
	- differences between individuals
- some things didn't fit a known species 
- Fossil record of extinct species
	- Did God make a mistake? Did He make imperfect things?
- Geologic evidence that Earth was much older than 7 days
	- collision with literal interpretation of Bible 
# Darwin and Wallace 
## Charles Darwin
- Son of wealthy doctor
- studied medicine
- joined Anglican clergy 
- influenced by naturalist professors
- passed exams, signed on to *Beagle*
### H.M.S. Beagle
- 5 year mission to chart South American coast 
- naturalist funded by crown and captain, but "Dad" picked up bill 
- variation of organism between islands = separate creations? 
- lots of fossils (marine fossils found on mountains#
- species doing same things in different locations
- next 10-15years sorting material from voyage
- publishes 5 volume work on travels, *Voyage of the Beagle* (1838)
## Alfred Russel Wallace:
- son of lower class laborer
- worked for position to explore
- financed own trip to South America, collected material but ship sank
- financed trip to Malaysia
- writes to Darwin in 1858 about his ideas from sickbed (malaria)
- became ardent supporter of Darwin 
- father of biogeography
## Publication
- Darwin: 
	- notebook in 1838
	- letter from Wallace in 1858
	- *The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection* (1859)
	- never finished larger manuscript
- Wallace
	- letter to Darwin from sickbed in 1858
	- Lyell had Darwin's & Wallace's papers read in Royal Society in 1858
		- unimpressive; "nothing of interest happened that year"
	- *Origin* (1859)
# Components of Natural Selection
- variation within a species
	- most important
	- there is no perfect or ideal form
- Inheritance of variability
	- mechanism was unknown then
	- use/disuse is inherited
- Struggle for Existence 
	- every organism has intense struggle
	- population size is not subject to chance, but competition 
	- very complex set of interactions
	- **ultimate goal:** maximum amount of reproduction & successful 
	- natural selection acted on by environment sufficient to cause evolution = change
## Challenges
- Lord Kelvin 
	- not enough time to account for this much change
- Henry Fleming Jenkin
	- Blending of inheritance would always water down any new mutations
- Darwin's Reaction
	- pangenesis
		- no evidence to support
# Evidence of Natural Selection
## Artificial Selection 
- humans select traits/modify through reproduction
	- breeds of dogs
