# Why Divide
- need more cells: replace normal wear and tear and senescence (growing old)
	- renewal and repair 
-  "Daughter" cells need all the heredity information as the "parent" cell 
- Growth and Development: get bigger, stronger, faster, etc.
- Sexual and Asexual reproduction 
# Cell Types
## Stem Cells
- blank slate cell: can become any other type of cell
- self renewal and differentiation
- capable of dividing/renewing for long periods of time
- unspecialized
	- leads to specialized cell types
- Sources: 
	- in embryos and some in adults
	- human embryonic stem cells: from in vitro fertilizations that were donated with consent
	- induced pluripotent stem cells: specialized adult cells that can be "re-programmed" to another function
## Other Dividing Cells
- i.e. liver cells will only divide into more liver cells
## Permanently Differentiated Cells
- permanently differentiated cell: cardiac muscle cells and brain cells normally do not divide 
	- new research challenging this 
	- can lay dormant for a time, then become "activated"
# Prokaryotic Cell Cycle  - Binary Fission
- chromosome is attached to cell membrane
- DNA in single, circular chromosome replicates 
- two chromosomes separate and move apart 
- new membrane added
- cleavage in between
- two new daughter cells

# Chromosome Organization in Eukaryotic Cells
- Folded, spiraled, compacted to fit within a nucleus 
- **gene**: lengths of DNA that code for a trait
- **locus**: geographical location on the chromosome of a gene 
- **Telomere**: "end" signal for the chromosome, located at each end
- **Centromere**: chromosome movement
Duplicated chromosome: chromosome DNA is replicated (copied
Sister Chromatids: two identical DNA helices attached at the centromeres)
- **homologues**: chromosomes that contain the same genes (not necessarily the exact DNA)
	- humans have 23 homologues (pairs) = 46 chromosomes
- **diploid**: *somatic* (not a sex cell) cells that have pairs of homologous chromosomes = 2n 
- Sex chromosomes: XX for female, XY for male in humans 
- **haploid**: half or only one type of each chromosome = 1n
	- sex cells
