# Elements
- An Element cannot be divided and still be the same thing
- \# protons = atomic number
- Mass = protons + neutrons + electron
- 92% of an average organism consists of
	1. **Oxygen**
	2. **Carbon**
	3. **Hydrogen**
	4. **Calcium**
	5. **Nitrogen**
	6. **Phosphorous**
# Molecules
- 2 or more same atom held together with chemical bonds ($O_2$) 
- **Compound** = different atoms held with chemical bonds ($CO$, $CO_2$, **$C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}$** (**Glucose** - 6 carbon sugar))
# Chemical Bonds
Holds Molecules together
1. **Covalent**: Strongest, most common, electrically neutral, shares electrons 
2. **Ionic**: Loss or gain of electrons from ions to form a stable compound ($NaCl$)
3. **Hydrogen**: Weak, slightly polar and therefore attractive to other slightly polar molecules ($H_{2}O$ molecules sticking to other $H_{2}O$ molecules) 
# Water
- Water is Cohesive
	- **Cohesion**: Water molecules stick together because of the hydrogen bonds
- **Surface tension**: Resistance to being broken
- Water is Adhesive
	- **Adhesive**: Sticky to slightly charged surfaces
		- Allows plants/trees to deliver water hundreds of feet against gravity
		- Allows water in plasma to be returned to heart from your big toe
- Universal *solvent* for life 
- **Hydrophobic**: "water fearing"; parts of cell membranes
- **Hydrophilic**: "Water loving"
	- Molecules that are attracted to water
	- Many biological compounds
	- Parts of membranes
# Cell Membrane
Lipid bilayer
Outside: Hydrophilic
Inside: Hydrophobic

# Acids 
- Yields H+ ions in solution
- Strong = $HCl$ or hydrochloric acid
- Weak = milk
- 0-6.99 on pH scale
- Causes pain and tissue necrosis due to fat **hydrolysis** (breaking something using water) - instant (sulfuric acid)
	- Acids break apart fats 
# Bases 
- Yields OH- ions in solution
- Strong = $NaOH$ drain cleaner
- Weak = blood, sweat, baking soda
- 7.01 to 14 on pH scale
- Usually causes delayed pain via protein *denaturation* (breaking protein bonds) - sodium hydroxide (longer contact and deeper tissue damage)
