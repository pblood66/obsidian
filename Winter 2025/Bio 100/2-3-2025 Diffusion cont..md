Test covers Ch 1-6, 8
# Simple Diffusion
- very small, non-polar, lipid soluble
- $O_{2}, CO_{2},$ alcohols, some vitamin, steroids, of course $H_{2}O$ 
- free; requires nothing 
# Facilitated Diffusion
- very small, ions, water, soluble
- **Channel proteins** 
	- helps molecules cross the membrane
- still down a gradient
	- area of high concentration to area of low concentration
- Can go both directions 
- free; requires no ATP
# Osmosis
- diffusion of $H_{2}O$ down a gradient
- Tonicity - numerical way to measure how much of something is dissolved in water
- Free 
	- **Isotonic**: equal concentration of water and solute
	- **Hypertonic**: more solute (less water) than other side of membrane
	- **Hypotonic**: less solute (more water) than other side of membrane
# Active Transport
- very small, ions moving across the membrane 
- against a gradient - "uphill"
- requires ATP
- $Na^{+}/K^+$ pump
	- how muscle fibers contract and relax in a coordinated way
## Endocytosis
- endo meaning into
- **pinocytosis**: "cell drinking" by way of in-folding and vesicles
- **receptor-mediated**: proteins along membrane combine with specific molecules, then in-fold (steroids, iron)
- **Phagocytosis**: "cell eating" membrane arms extend and engulf particles (white blood cells) 
- requires ATP
## Exocytosis
- exo- meaning out of
- particles or large molecules
- vesicles move things like waste, hormones, and neurotransmitters to membrane and released (faster than simple diffusion) 
	- $Ca^{++}$ into synaptic space between nerve cells
- ex. Rattlesnake venom: interrupts the process of exocytosis with neurotransmitters -> paralysis
# Metabolism
- **The Mitochondria**
## Energy Flow through a system
- Chemical Reaction: builds or breaks bonds
	- Reactants -> products
	- **exergonic**: gives energy (heat)
	- **endergonic**: requires energy input
## Building Energy/ATP
$C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + 6O_2$ -> energy + $6CO_{2}+ 6H_{2}O$ 

Hypoxia - low oxygen -> low energy output

## Activation Energy 
- little bit of energy to jump start a chemical reaction
## Moving Energy around
- **electron carriers**
- ATP: most common **energy-carrier molecule**
	- comes from breakdown of glucose 
	- highly unstable (easy to break)
	- Only within the cell; not cell to cell
		- too big
## Coupled Reaction
- Very common in cells 
- Exergonic provides energy for endergonic
	- ATP from glucose breakdown "fires" protein synthesis in endergonic 
		- Activation energy
	- Exer- and endo- commonly occur in different places
	- need a carrier like ATP or electrons
	- relatively slow
## Catalysts & Enzymes
- catalysts speed of reaction
- enzymes: biological catalysts
	- lower activation energy 
	- speed up exer and endo reactions
	- not used up; recycled
## Enzymes
- lock/key scenario
	- very specific shape
	- some only act when there is coenzyme
	- substrate contacts active site
	- change in shape causes reaction
	- substrate leaves enzyme
