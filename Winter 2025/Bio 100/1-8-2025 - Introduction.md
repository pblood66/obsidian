# Principles and Inquiry
## Three Assumptions
- Natural Causality
	- Things happen because of natural causes
- Natural Laws
	- What we observe adheres to natural laws
- See things similarly
	- We all have different perceptions and perspectives
	- How do we universalize the language of science?
		- Numbers - Quantify what we observe
# Scientific Method
1. Observation
2. Question (Why does it do that?)
3. Hypothesis
	- **Inductive Reasoning**: Many individual facts that lead to a general conclusion - method of discovery
	- **Deductive Reasoning**: if this... Then that; general to specific - method of verifying 
4. Experiment 
	- Testable; not magic
	- One prediction at a time 
	- One variable at a time
	- must have controls (non-altered group)
	- quantitative, not qualitative
	- large sample size
5. Conclusion
	- Repeatable
	- Peer review
	- Communication
	- Scientists are human
	- Falsification
# Evolution
1. Variation among individuals
2. Variation is inherited
-  Natural Selection maintains inherited characteristics that help the individuals survive and thrive
