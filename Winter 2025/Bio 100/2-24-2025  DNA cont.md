# DNA replicates - so what
- central dogma: DNA -> RNA -> protein 
- Chain of command for the cell
- Beadle & Tatum: "one gene, one enzyme" 
	- One specific gene codes for one specific enzyme
	- most enzymes are proteins, but not all proteins are enzymes
	- Revised: "**one specific gene codes for one specific protein**"
# Location 
- nuclear DNA is found in the nucleus
- Proteins are made by the ribosomes in cytoplasm
- how to export information to ribosomes in cytoplasm? 
# RNA 
- ribonucleic acid 
	- structure differences: 
	- usually single-stranded instead of double
	- ribose sugar instead of deoxyribose sugar
	- uracil base instead of thymine 
## Types
- *mRNA*: messenger RNA
- *rRNA*: ribosomal RNA 
- *tRNA*: transfer RNA 
### mRNA 
- code for amino acid sequence of protein from DNA to ribosomes in nucleus
- messenger this to the cytoplasm from the nucleus 
### rRNA 
- important ingredient (along with other proteins) in making ribosomes
- necessary in attaching to mRNA and translating code to tRNA 
### tRNA 
- carries ("transfers") the correct amino acid to ribosome 
- uses ATP to attach amino acid to one end
- anticodon bases protrude from other end 
# Transcription Summary
- code from DNA is transcribed into mRNA
	- in nucleus
- base sequence that is complimentary to DNA strand 
# Translation
- mRNA code is decoded in tRNA, then translated into amino acid sequence of protein
	- in cytoplasm 
- tRNA base sequence is complimentary to mRNA base sequence 
- mRNA -> protein

# Genetic Code 
- read in 3 base groups
- UUU = phenylalanine
- AUG = "start"
- UAA, UAG, and UGA = stop
- mRNA triplets are called codon
- tRNA complimentary bases are called anticodons
# Transcription in Detail
- RNA polymerase binds to the beginning of a gene at the promoter region (TATAAA) on DNA
- **Initiation** 
	- double strand DNA unwinds
- **Elongation**
	- template DNA strand used to build a complimentary strand of mRNA
- **Termination**
	- DNA termination signals causes RNA polymerase to let go
	- RNA molecule is released
	- DNA then re-winds back in double helix shape
	- RNA polymerase will move onto another gene 
# mRNA modification
- DNA is transcribed into mRNA
- more RNA nucleotides to form cap and tail 
	- prevents degradation in cytoplasm 
- *introns* ("noncoding" regions) are cut out 
- *exons* are pasted together 
- pasted exons leaves the nucleus 
## What are the Introns for?
- many possible splicing arrangements = many possible proteins from a single gene
- introns are the groovy place for evolution (change) of new proteins
