# Cell Theory
- Cell is the fundamental unit of an organism
- Organisms can be single-cell or trillions of cells
- All cells come from pre-existing cells
	- Where did that first cell come from?
# Plasma Membrane 
- separates the outside from the inside
- Phospholipid 
	- Polar heads (Hydrophilic)
	- Non polar tails - (Hydrophobic)
- Gatekeeper for materials
	- Allows some things to go in and keep others out
		- Based on conditions
- Communications with its neighbor cells
	- Capable of detecting self and not self cells
		- i.e. white blood cells, t cells
# Cytoplasm
- the "goo" inside the cell, but outside the nucleus
- *Cyto-* - cell
- Enzyme and other protein synthesis happens here
# Heredity
- DNA and RNA as genetic material
	- All the instructions to make another you
- All information to produce new proteins, new nuclei, new "daughter" cells
# Prokaryotic Cells
- very simple, comparatively small 
- Nearly all have a cell wall (this promotes shape)
- Outer capsule for surface attachment
- Some have flagella for movement
- pili for transfer of gametes between other cells
	- Reproduction
- unbounded nucleoid
	- Doesn't have a phospholipid bilayer membrane around it's DNA 
	- Single, circular chromosome
- Some have "free-floating" rings of DNA = **plasmid**
	- May or may not belong to the organism
- **Ribosomes** - protein factory
### Shapes 
- Bacillus - Tic tac shaped
- Spirillum - Spiral shaped
- Cocci - spherical shaped
# Eukaryotic Cells
- Some have cell walls (plants and fungi) for support and protection
	- Animal cells do not have cell walls
- Some have cilia and flagella for locomotion
- **Cytoskeleton** is framework inside cytoplasm
	- Structure 
		- Steel Girders of the cell
	- Shape 
	- Cell movement (sperm, muscle cells)
	- Organelle movement (highway system)
	- Cell division
- All of the genetic material is squished inside a nuclear membrane 
	- Protects genetic material from the more hostile cytoplasm environment
## Organelles
- **Nucleus**: control center of the cell 
	- membrane bound but porous
	- **Chromosomes**: strands of DNA within nucleus
	- **Nucleolus**: ribosome factory
- **Ribosomes** built in the nucleolus move to cytoplasm and build proteins 
- **Golgi**: receives, sorts, builds stores, and sends proteins from the ER to other destinations
	- Delivery system of the cell
- **vesicles** carry specials contents like waste & other proteins along to the cell membrane
	- Hazmat of the cell
	- Liver has a lot of vesicles
- **Lysosomes** carry hydrolytic enzymes to digest large molecules 
- **Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)**: Produces new components of a membrane (membrane proteins and new phospholipids)
	- **Smooth ER**: No ribosomes, steroid production, detox enzymes in liver, calcium storage
	- **Rough ER**: long chains of attached ribosomes for protein production
		- Making membrane proteins
	- Products are shipped off the ER to the Golgi
- **Mitochondria**: "powerhouse of cell", produces ATP with/without $O_{2}$ (Aerobic/Anaerobic)
	- Mitochondria also have their own DNA from mother's side
		- separate from the nuclear DNA
