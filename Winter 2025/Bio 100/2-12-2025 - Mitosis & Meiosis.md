# Eukaryotic Cell Cycle: **Mitosis**
## *Interphase*
phase that doesn't actively divide (preparation phase) 
	- acquires nutrients, grows and differentiates, prepares for division
	- $G_1$: growth and differentiation
	- $S$: DNA synthesis
	- $G_{2}$: growth and division prep

## Prophase
- Chromosomes condense
- spindle forms
- nucleolus disappears; nuclear membrane dissolves
- kinetochore hold chromosomes to spindle
## Metaphase
- Kinetochores line up on equator
- nuclear membrane still dissolved
## Anaphase
- sister chromatids separate
- move to poles
## Telophase 
- Chromosomes decondense
- nuclear envelop starts to re-form
- spindle disappears
## Cytokinesis 
- Microfilaments contracts
- Each daughter cell has 1 nucleus and 1/2 of the cytoplasm
- back to interphase 
## Review
- Purpose - make more cells for several reasons
- Location - Everywhere but in gamete-producing organs
- In humans, 46 chromosomes or 23 homologous pairs
# Meiosis 
- each daughter cell has 1 member of homologous pair
- cuts the number of chromosomes in half
- Sperm/egg has 23 chromosomes
	- Only happens in sex cells 
- Keeps chromosome number constant 
- Meiosis has two splits

## Meiosis I
### Prophase I
- duplicated chromosomes condense
- homologues pair up and cross over 
- nuclear envelope disappears
- spindle forms
### Metaphase I 
- paired homologues line up on equator
- kinetochores attach to spindle
### Anaphase I 
- Spindle contracts and pull chromosomes to opposite poles
- sister chromatids stay together
### Telophase I
- spindle disappears 
- cytokinesis follows
- microfilaments contract
## Meiosis II 
### Prophase II 
- Chromosomes recondense 
- nuclear envelope disappears 
- spindle re-forms and attach to sister chromatids
### Metaphase II 
- Chromosomes line up on equator
- attached to spindle by kinetochore 
### Anaphase II
- chromatids separate
- move to opposite poles 
### Telophase II 
- nuclear envelop re-forms
- chromosomes decondense 
- microfilaments contracts
## Review
- 4 haploid gametes
- 1 member of each pair of homologues 
# Genes and Inheritance 
## Terms 
- *Gene*: a unit of inheritance; some length of DNA that codes for a particular trait 
- *Locus (loci)* - the physical location of a gene
- *allele*: different versions of the same trait/gene at a specific locus
	- typically use letters  to represent
	- AA, Aa, aa 
- *homozygous*: same allele on both homologous chromosomes 
	- AA, aa
- *heterozygous*: different allele on homologous chromosomes
	- hybrid: Aa
## Mendel's Experiments
- edible pea: capable of 
	- **self-fertilization**: male stamen produce pollen that fertilizes female egg in same plant
	- **cross-fertilization**: male stamen of one plant fertilizes female egg of different plant
- **true-breeding**: some trait that is inherited unchanged by all offspring of self-fertilization 
- white flower (self) x white flower (same self) 
	- all white flower offspring
- purple flower (self) x purple flower (same self)
	- all purple flower offspring
- *parent* = P
- *offspring* = $F_{1}$ 
- true breed purple x true breed white
	- all purple offspring ($F_{1}$)
	- purple allele is completely dominant over the white allele
-
