# Enzymes 
- baby steps - many small reactions with many enzymes
- gradual energy transfer
- Increase Reaction?
	- increase enzyme: 
		- increase enzyme synthesis, inactive forms (pepsin)
	- increase substrate
# Enzyme Regulation
- in each individual cell
- **competitive inhibitor**: molecule blocks the active site - won't work (TB bacterium and vaccine, toxin of Parkinson's)
	- *Something In the Way* - Nirvana
- **Non-competitive inhibitor**: some other molecule binds to the enzyme and distorts the shape
	- enzyme changes shape, no longer useful
- **Feedback inhibition**: end product of multi-enzyme reaction inhibits start of reaction
	- large amounts of ATP can block production of more ATP
		- ATP non-competitively binds with one of the starting enzymes, thus turning off thE the production
## Examples
- ibuprofen
	- non-competitive inhibitor on pain receptors
- green in potatoes 
	- neurotoxins inhibit acetylcholinesterase leads to paralysis
- Ricin in castor beans
	- irreversible inhibitor on ribosomes
# Cellular Respiration
### Life Requires Energy
- organismal and cellular maintenance
- protein and DNA synthesis
- trans-membrane movement 
- organismal and cellular movement 
- growth and reproduction
## $C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + 6O_{2} -> 6CO_{2} + 6H_{2}O$ $+$ Energy
- ATP is highly reactive and unstable
- Hydrolysis of ATP is exergonic -> ADP
	- $ATP + H_2O -> ADP + P$ + Energy
- Cell Respiration regenerates ATP 
## What's Our ROI?
1 molecule of glucose makes
- 38 molecules of ATP in prokaryotes
- 36-38 molecules ATP in eukaryotes
## 3 Step Process
- Glycolysis 
	- breaks apart the glucose molecule
	- outside of the mitochondria
	- 2 ATP
- Kreb's Cycle
	- Citric Acid cycle
	- Inside the mitochondria
	- 2 ATP
- Electron Transport Chain
	- bulk of ATP
	- cascade series of reactions
	- 32-34 ATP
## "Harvesting" chemical energy
- **Aerobic respiration**: plants and animals are strict aerobes
	- survives only in an oxygen environment
	- Most of the ATP comes from oxidative phosphorylation
	- $O_{2}$ is final electron acceptor
- **Anaerobic Respiration**: some bacteria in anaerobic environments
	- does not require $O_{2}$ 
	- poisoned by presence of $O_{2}$
	- sulfate or nitrate is the final electron acceptor (smelly)
	- leads to fermentation
- **Fermentation**: ATP is built without electron transport chain
	- Not efficient
	- no $O_{2}$ required 
	- organic molecule like lactic acid or ethanol, are the final electron acceptors
	- *facultative anaerobes* can function with or without $O_{2}$ (ferment or respirate) depending on conditions 
		- E. coli
## Humans Fermenting
- in the absence of $O_{2}$ 
- sugar breakdown outpaces muscles supply of oxygen
- lactic acid is product
- solution: keep breathing, keep bringing in oxygen
## Hydrolysis of other molecules
- glucose is not common in human diets
	- fat, proteins, sucrose, starch that glycolysis can't break down 
- digested fats and stored fats
	- 1g of fat produces 2x ATP than 1g of glucose
	- lightweight 
	- takes longer to lose 
	-
