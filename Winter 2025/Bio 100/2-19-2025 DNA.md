# DNA Structure
- 4 nucleotides each made of:
	- Phosphate group
	- Deoxyribose sugar
	- Nitrogen containing base 
		- Adenine A
		- Guanine G
		- Thymine T
		- Cytosine C
# Wilkins/Franklin 
- X-ray diffraction:
	- shoot DNA with x-rays
- typical "X" pattern of a helix
- repeating subunits
- measurable
## Watson/Crick Model
- ball & stick modelers
- no actual data
- racing against Linus Pauling at CalTech
- Looked at Franklin's work
- two strands made of sugar/phosphate backbone
- protruding nucleotide bases 

Hydrogen bonds hold nucleotides together 
complimentary base pairs
# DNA Replication
- S phase within interphase
- each daughter cell gets a perfect (almost) copy of the parent cell DNA 
## Enzymes
1. **DNA Helicase**: breaks the H bonds holding the base pairs together 
	- "Unzips" the DNA 
2. **DNA Polymerase**: Pairs up the exposed bases with new (free), complimentary bases
3. **DNA Ligase**: stitch pieces of replicated DNA together from the lagging strand 
## Errors
 - not very common  (1 in every 1K to 100K) 
 - most are "proofread" and repaired by DNA repair enzymes 
 - **Point mutation**: single nucleotide base is incorrect or incorrectly changed 
	 - substitutions: repair enzymes replace with the wrong base
	 - Insertion: an extra base inserted into the strand 
	 - deletion: removes a base from the strand
	 - inversion: piece(s) of DNA are taken out turned around, then re-inserted
- **Translocation**: whole globs of DNA taken off one chromosome and attached to another
