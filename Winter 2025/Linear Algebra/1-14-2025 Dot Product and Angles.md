suppose you have $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ and put their tails together, they make an angle between each other.

Every 2 vectors have a vector even in $\mathbb{R}^3$ 

# Law of Cosines
Suppose you have a triangle $abc$ with angles $\alpha\beta\gamma$

$c^{2}= a^{2}+ b^{2}- 2ab\cos{\gamma}$ 

Let $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\theta$ be the angle between them
Then
$\vec{u}\cdot\vec{v} = \lvert\vec{u}\rvert\lvert\vec{v}\rvert\cos\theta$
