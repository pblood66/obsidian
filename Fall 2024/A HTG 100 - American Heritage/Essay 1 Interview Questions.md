When you were in college, what did you believe liberty and freedom meant (Both individual and collective liberty)
Has that view changed as you've gotten older? Why or why not?

Do any particular events in US history (policies, conflicts, etc.) that you lived through particularly stand out? why?
Did those events, if any affect, your view on the role/purpose of the government? If so how?

Do you feel that the US has become more or less equal?

Have you always participated in voting (local & federal)? What do you feel is your civic duty?

What do you define as "The American Dream"?

Are there any values or morals that are needed to cultivate a good society?
