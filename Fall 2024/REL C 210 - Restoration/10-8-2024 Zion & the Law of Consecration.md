**Zion** is a people that love God and others so much that they eliminate poverty
- The law of consecration gets us to Zion

**Consecration** - The action of making something sacred
The Law of Consecration is like a stool with three legs
1. Agency
2. Stewardship (What we can act upon, anything we can influence comes from God **D&C 104**)
3. Accountability
D&C 42:30 "*Thou wilt remember the poor*"
Remember that you are both the rich and you are the poor
