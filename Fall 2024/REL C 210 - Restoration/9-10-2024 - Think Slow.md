![[01 Think slow so you know how you know what you know.pdf]]

A slow thinker is a metacognitive thinker
- you are aware of your own thought process
- Avoid heuristics (mental shortcuts) by thinking about how you know what you know
Identify your assumptions and interrogate them
- What You See Is All There Is (**WYSIATI**)
Prove contrarieties 
- accommodate ambiguity, reject false dilemmas

		- He is both at the same time D&C 133
Interpret intentionally with a hermeneutic[^1] of faith, hope, and charity
- Verifiable facts and the interpretations of the facts are different
- Rationality is not the only tool to get to truth
	- Rational people can come to a variety of interpretations
