**Bit:** 0 or 1
**Byte** = 8 bit chunk (basic unit of memory)

**Memory** is just an array of bytes
- Each byte has an address (**Byte-Addressable**)

# Bytes and Types
*char* - 1 byte
*int* - 4 bytes
- *short* - 2 bytes
- *long* - 4/8 bytes [^1]
*float* - 4 bytes
- *double* - 8 bytes
 *int32_t* - 4 bytes
 *int64_t* - 8 bytes
 *char \** - 4/8 bytes
- pointer type
- stores a memory address
# Hexadecimal notation
Uses 16 symbols
- 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, b, c, d, e, f
Used to represent contents of memory
- 1 letter = 4 Bits
- 2 letters = 1 byte
	- 10010101 = 95
Hexadecimal numbers are written with a leading x or 0x
- i.e. 0x1234ab
