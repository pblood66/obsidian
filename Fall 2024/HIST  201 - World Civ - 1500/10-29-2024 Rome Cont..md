# Diocletian Reforms
Diocletian was one of the few Barrack emperors who died of natural causes
- Restored a level of order and stability
- Divided the empire into four regions and established a tetrarchy of four co-emperors
- Responsible for the greatest of all persecutions of the Christians
	- ironically just a few years before Christianity became the state religion
	- used the Christians as a scapegoat
## Tetrarchy
Two "augustuses" (senior emperors) and two "caesars" (Junior emperors) ruled jointly.
- In theory the augustuses could retire and let the caesars replace them, thus avoiding wars of succession
- System continued imperfectly in various regimes after Diocletian
# Constantine and Christianity
Became "caesar" and later "augustus" of the west
- Battle at Milvian Bridge 312
- Edict of Milan 313
- Turned Byzantium into the new Rome: Constantinople
- Council of Nicaea, 325
# Roman Pluralism 
- Traditional Roman religion with a variety of gods and goddesses
- Rational philosophies
- Syncretistic versions of eastern belief systems
- Mystery religions, Judaism, and Christianity, filled unmet spiritual needs
- Roman law usually respected local custom
- Roman government tolerated many religions (with notable exceptions from time to time, such as Nero's persecution of Christians)
# Mystery Religion
A religion that holds a special belief in a knowledge where only people initiated into the religion were designated to know
- You had to be in the religion to receive secret knowledge 
It forms a community of its members 
- creates a sense of belonging
They're often syncretistic of eastern beliefs 
- For example the Cult of Isis (Western mystery religion that mixed Eastern beliefs with Western)
Mystery Religions usually focus on eternal life
- Resurrection 
Are Judaism and Christianity mystery religions? 
- Yes
Cult of Mithras 
# Roman State Religion
- Roman state religion was a patriotic duty, and eventually included worship of the living emperor
- In addition to the state religion, many people had their own personal beliefs, local customs, philosophy, or variety of faith practices
- "Religious freedom" existed so long as Romans who believed in other gods also observed the main practices of the state religion.
- This was a problem for Christians and Jews, who believed in exclusive truth and only one God
# Judaism in Roman Times
Several denominations
- Pharisees: Most numerous, believed in the resurrection and followed Law of moses strictly
- Sadducees: A minority, often of a higher social class Denied the resurrection. Admired Greco-Roman culture and philosophy. Tended to cooperate with Greek and Roman overlords
- Essenes: Dead Sea Scrolls. Baptism. Strict minority.
- Zealots: Anti-Roman political movement
Judaism existed all over the Roman Empire and even beyond. Big communities in Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, Persia, Egypt, Spain, and elsewhere. Often used Septuagint, a Greek translation of the Old Testament
# Early Christianity
- A new religion or a version of Judaism?
	- Probably viewed as another denomination of Judaism
	- True or Restored Judaism
- Jews, Gentiles, and Proselytes (Converts to Judaism)
- The day of Pentecost - people present from all over
- Christianity spread at first through Jewish communities in the Roman world 
# Later Roman Christianity
- Culturally less Jewish
- Several branches of Christianity developed with different beliefs
- No central authority - five early patriarchs (prestigious bishop) who had prestige but no canonical supremacy
	- Jerusalem
	- Antioch
	- Alexandria
	- Rome (pope)
	- Constantinople
# Spread of Christianity
During the Pax Romana
- Roman world was interconnected culturally and economically and shared a lingua franca of Greekin the east and Latin in the West
- Roads, shipping and travel safety were better than they had ever been
- Imperial government, trade, and military service gave vast numbers of people a reason to be mobile
# Demographics
- Christianity grew especially in cosmopolitan cities among people uprooted from traditional rural ties
- "Pagan" comes from Latin *paganus* which means a peasant or country person. The Germanic equivalent "heathen" is someone from the "heath" which is the undeveloped countryside
