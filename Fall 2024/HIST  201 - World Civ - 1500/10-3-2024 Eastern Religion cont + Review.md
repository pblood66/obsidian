# Buddhism
## The Buddha
- The "enlightened One" - achieved enlightenment while he was alive through meditation and living an austere life (asceticism)
- Other *bodhisattvas*(someone who has attained enlightenment like Buddha) are possible
- Not a god but revered
## Beliefs
- rejected caste system and authority of the Vedas (scripture) and the Brahmins
- Nontheistic religion but allows for gods
- belief in the "*middle way*" (no exact way)
- many beliefs are similar to Hinduism: 
	- reincarnation, karma, etc. Some different vocabulary
- **Nirvana** (transcendent freedom) is a release from reincarnation and reuniting with the Ultimate.
- Monks and nuns are important in Buddhism
## Branches of Buddhism
Different major branches and subtypes
- **Theravada** (Sri Lanka, Burma, SE Asia) believed to be the most similar to the ancient Indian Buddhism
- **Mahayana** (China, Japan, Korea) Zen in Japan emphasized meditation
- **Vajrayana** (Tibetan Mahayana)
# Confucianism
- Confucius, 551-479 BC wrote the *Analects*
- More of a philosophy, influenced politics
- Concerned with right behavior here and now, not with the cosmos, gods, or an afterlife
- Right behavior is to follow the *Dao*, the Way
	- Duty, "filial piety" = family loyalty, honor elders, ancestors
	- Humanity and compassion, high morals
	- Civic responsibility 
- Confucian ideals undergird much in Chinese society, regardless of religion
- Modern Confucianism is compatible with other belief systems
# Daoism
Being and acting in harmony with nature
- allow yourself to be guided by nature 
**Lao-Tzu**, "Old Master", 500's BC
- A religious movement with monks and nun but more of a philosophy
- Not so concerned with gods or salvation
- Following the *Dao* means to act in harmony with nature which implies *spontaneity* rather than conscious action - *wu wei* (inaction)
- Magic, martial arts, supernatural power
- Often at odds with Confucianism historically
	- Daoism is about inaction and going with the flow
	- Confucianism is about making choices to be righteous 
- Today seen as compatible with a variety of beliefs
