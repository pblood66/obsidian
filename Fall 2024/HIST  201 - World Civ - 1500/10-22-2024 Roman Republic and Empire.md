# SPQR Senatus Populusque Romanus
## Before the Romans,
Several people were in Italy before the Romans, including Mycenaean Greeks
Lots of different ethnicities
*Etruscans* (Tuscany) and Greeks are the ones who contributed most directly to Roman culture
- Arrived in Italy before 100 BC
- Used an alphabet borrowed from Greeks
- Continued in northern Italy until 300s BC
# Roman Republic 509-27 BC
Res = Thing 
Publica = Public
Legendary foundation of Rome
- Republic probably resulted from a revolt by Latins against an Etruscan king about 509
- Government by the Senate (patrician class), led by two elected consuls. (Senator = elder)
- In time, commoners (plebeians) were allowed to elect Tribunes, who had veto power in the Senate
Many other officers were added over time
# Conquest 
Romans took over almost whole Mediterranean by 50 BC
# Punic Wars
- Rivalry with Carthage (known as "Punt" = Phoenician) in Western Mediterranean
- Rome fought three long wars against Carthage from 264-146 BC
- Carthage was annihilated
- Resulted in Rome becoming a great sea power and in controlling entire western Mediterranean 
# The Late Republic 130-31 BC
- A time of wealth and military success, but also of political instability
- Rival generals often fought wars against each other out in the provinces
- Instead of the Senate controlling the military as in the past, leading military leaders began to influence and control the Senate
- Riots of commoners and slave revolts
# Dictator
- Phenomenon of the late republic
- They were powerful and popular generals
- The justification for rule by a dictator was that he could rescue the republic in its hour of need
- Officially dictators operated under authority of the Senate as the republic's protector
- Julius Caesar, the last dictator, was murdered in 44 BC by traditionalist senators who wanted to return power to the Senate
# Transition to Empire
Caesar's nephew, Octavius, became the undisputed leader by defeating Antony and Cleopatra
- The Senate declared him Augustus, "imperator", "pontifex maximus", and "princeps". Each title was significant legally to legitimize his authority
- As Augustus Caesar, Octavian upheld the fiction that he was restoring the republic. The theory was that emperors received their authority from the Senate and the people. But beginning with Augustus it was clear that Roman emperors were in near-absolute control, despite the fiction that they served the people and Senate 
# Theory of Kingship (*Imperator* not Rex)
"Imperator" is a title meaning commander or one who commands
- This authority was symbolized by an "imperium" an ivory baton with an eagle on top, which was awarded to a general for triumph. By tradition, a general celebrating a triumph could do whatever he wanted temporarily 
- Augustus Caesar, as imperator, was the legal equivalent of a general in a perpetual state of triumph thus he was permanently above the law
- This title had been used occasionally before; but after Augustus, it became the normal title of the Roman ruler
- The empire kept the trappings of the republic, but the emperors were absolute rulers
- Later was honored as a god on earth
# Golden Age of Rome 31 BC -180 AD
**Pax Romana** (Roman peace)
- The whole Mediterranean world was more or less at peace with steady expansion
- Roman law was respected and its culture was adopted
- Engineering, public works, and commerce flourished
Several good emperors followed Augustus and contributed toward Rome's greatness
- A few, however, were notoriously bad: Caligula, Nero, and Commodus 
### Nero
- killed his own mom
- Persecuted the Christians 
- Nero kills himself
	- "How great an artist dies with me"
# Crisis in the 3rd Century 
- Economic problems, extremes between rich and poor. *Latifundia*
- "Barbarian" threats along the frontiers 
- The military meddled in politics constantly (*Praetorian Guard*)
- Army had great numbers of foreigners 
# The "Barracks Emperors"
- Promising the troops a bonus - a common political tactic
- Emperors at this time never died of natural causes
- Put into office by the army. Lasted just a few years each
