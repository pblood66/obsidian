# Alexander the Great
After his death, the empire became broken apart; created a power vacuum
- Generals fought amongst themselves
1. Ptolomies (Egypt)
	- Ptolomy - descendant of Cleopatra
2. Seleucids (Turkey & Western Asia)
# Classical Architecture
*Won't be tested on this*
Pillars are characterized by their tops
- Doric - most basic
- Ionic - Scrolls
- Corinthian - Intricate leaves 
**The Golden Mean or Golden Ratio** - Used by the Greeks in art and architecture
# Greek Philosophy
**Philosophy** = Love of Wisdom
- In ancient Greece it was science and systematic thought
- Some philosophers, like Pythagoras, had a religious aspect to their system
Greek philosophy came to dominate all learning and science, spread abroad and influenced religion in important ways
- One of the most important legacies of the world
1. Socrates 469-399 BC
2. Plato 428-348 BC
3. Aristotle 384-322 BC
### Socrates
- "Socratic method" - Teaching through asking questions
- Prized truth and good
- No writings 
- His teachings are recoded in dialogues written by his disciples, including Plato
- very popular, but made enemies because of his popularity and the fact that he relentlessly questioned things 
- Was executed for "corrupting the youth" of Athens
### Plato 
- Disciple of Socrates
- Founded "the Academy"
- Theory of "forms"
	- ideal archetype of the imperfect earthly objects around us
	- The ultimate form is the Good (God>)
	- Forms are not accessible to the senses only through pure reason can we begin to understand them
- Virtue is knowledge of the Good, related to wisdom, courage, temperance, justice
- Influential for centuries 
### Aristotle
- Plato's most important disciple
- Emphasized experience, not reason
- Philosophy - science
- Sought universal conclusions inferred from observations, but he got a lot of things wrong. Not much for experimenting to find truth
- Tutored Alexander the Great
- Enormously influential right up to the Age of Enlightenment
## Platonism
- Included belief in "forms" and "ideas"
- Emphasized reason over superstition
- distrust of the material world and the physical senses, focus on reason
- Appeared and reappeared in various form that influenced other philosophies for centuries
- Influenced Christianity.  for example the Mystery of the Trinity
## Stoicism
- Most popular philosophy in the Greco-Roman world
- An important influence on later reception of Christianity
- Beliefs 
	- All are brothers and sisters and of equal worth
	- Rule of law
	- Don't be deceived by mortal accomplishment and fame. They are only temporary
	- We are subject to Fate or Fortune (Tyche), which we can't control. We must patiently bear our hardships
	- A simple virtuous life is what counts in the end
	- Harmony with nature (similar to Daoism)
## Cynicism 
- Diogenes 412-323 BC
- Stoic 2.0; more extreme: practiced asceticism 
- questioned traditional customs and conventions, didn't participate in politics
- More admired than copied because of ascetic tendencies - not for the uncommitted
## Epicureans
- Epicurus (340 -270 BC)
- based on rational or scientific explanation, especially "atomism"
- Criticized religious superstition, though didn't deny the existence of gods
	- We're not influenced by Fat or Fortune, but all is explainable by natural and rational factors
- The physical world is what matters. You can't always trust your senses, but you for sure can't trust anything else, so measure whether something is good or not by whether it brings pleasure or pleases the senses. Seek to please the senses. Not to excess, however, because over-indulgence can have negative consequences
