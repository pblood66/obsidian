# India
4 main religions "**native**" to India (Sikhism came much later after the 1500's)
- Hinduism 
- Buddhism
- Jainism
# China
- Ancestor veneration and other early traditions
- Buddhism
	- Took root in China and became the "national religion" 
- Daoism
- Confucianism - more a philosophical movement but had religious overtones
	- State Confucianism
- Legalism - not really a religion
	- Everyone will do bad things unless you have harsh punishments
# Hinduism
- Very complex and diverse
	- A mixing of old Indo-Aryan ideas
- Accepts many traditions and practices, even paradoxical and contradictory ones
- Encompasses many different regional beliefs and traditions
	- Not one strict version of Hinduism
- Many view the religion as representing one truth and speak sincerely of "God" in the singular while accepting many different deities.
## Ancient Roots
### **Harappan or Pre-Aryan roots** 2500-1500 BC
- Belief in "the Goddess" still popular in some regions
- Possible caste system
### **Wandering ascetics**
- *Asceticism* is on of the most persistent themes of Indian beliefs
	- If you believe something you can give it up
	- Self-denial (fasting)
- Probably common even before the Aryans
- Wanderers dressed with minimal stuff
	- imparting wisdom as they go
### **Early Aryan roots** 1500-1000 BC
- Early gods similar to the gods of Olympus
- Early Aryan scripture: **The Vedas**, orally preserved  until written down about 100 BC (hymns)
	- Accepting authority of the Vedas makes you Hindu
- Emphasis on priests, rituals, and sacrifice
- No clear belief in reincarnation at this early time
- Caste system emerged during the Vedic period
## Reincarnation
At first a "secret" doctrine, probably not from the Aryans
- a belief some of the natives may have had
**Moksha** = release from the wheel of life. The End goal
"Twice-born" castes are the three highest 
Reincarnation is also part of Buddhism and Jainism
## Caste System

Top three castes are the "Twice born" groups
### Class vs Caste System
Absolute no upward movement in the caste system
Caste system incorporates a religious belief to the legitimacy of the system
- Dharma is different from caste to caste
## Dharma
- A moral law that all must follow
- It was thought to have divine origin 
- Even the king had to follow dharma
- Dharma is different for different people in Hinduism. 
	- One person's duty is not the same as another's different dharma for different castes
## Karma
- The fortune, good or bad, that attaches to one based on one's behavior and attitudes
- Good conduct brings a tendency toward happy results. Bad conduct brings a tendency toward bad results
## Three Main Gods of Classical Hinduism
- **Brahma** - Creator, personification of Brahman
- **Vishnu** - Preserver, intervener/savior
- **Shiva** - Destroyer, and paradoxically a creator
- There are thousands of others but most are considered as manifestations of the three
- Vishnu has several *avatars* or earthly manifestations (Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita)
## Brahm--?
- **Brahman** is the force or spirit of the universe as in Brahman-Atman (Like Brahman is the sea and Atman is the individual droplets that make up the sea)
- *Brahma* is the god who personifies Brahman
- *Brahmin* is a priest or member of the highest caste
# Jainism
High respect for life - each life is sacred even the insects
### Mahavira Jain
- Wandering holy man around 550-475 BC
- Same period as the Buddha
- He was a semilegendary figure
- Mahavira means "**great soul**"
- He made a path or "ford" to moksha and rejoining the ultimate through *strict asceticism*
- The greatest of 12 "ford makers"
## Beliefs
- Rejected the caste system
- Emphasized *asceticism* is the way to moksha
- Jains have no god but allow for many gods
	- Gods aren't important for moksha
- Reincarnation, karma, dharma, moksha, etc.
- Monks and nuns but no priests
- Non-injury to other beings, "maybe-ism"
- Those who achieve moksha rejoin the infinite where they float forever in the head of the universe
# Buddhism
- Developed around 500 BC, **Siddhartha Gautama**, the Buddha, in Nepal
- Period of discontent with Brahmins and ritual and religious fervor concerning salvation
- Before Ashoka, Buddhism was persecuted
- Buddhism spread to other regions of Asian and west to Afghanistan and Central Asia
- The "middle path"
