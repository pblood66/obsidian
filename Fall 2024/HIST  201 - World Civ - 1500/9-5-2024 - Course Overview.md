# Patterns of History
- History is cyclical in the same way that the economy cycles. It won't always be the same
- Divine Purpose or Providence?
- Downward trending?
	- Are we just crashing towards the end?
- Upward trending?
	- Are we improving/better off?
- Survival of the fittest?
- Is there even a pattern or is it wholly unpredictable?

# What is Civilization?
- From the Latin word *civitas* meaning citizenship, city, or the body politic
- as opposed to *barbaricus* meaning barbarian or foreigner
## Agricultural surplus
- stable food supply. Settled agriculture can support a large population
- A settled society
## Stratification
- Specialization within the society
- Not a need for everyone to be involved in food production
	- Rulers, religious leaders, teachers, builders, merchants, etc.
	- Public works, like large buildings, monuments, irrigation, etc.

In addition to these "big two," the diversified activity made possible by an agricultural surplus commonly results in:
- Advances in technology
- Improved economic power and trade (long distance trade indicates a very advanced society)
- Written language

# Mythos
*Mythos* meaning "story" or "plot". Doesn't necessarily refer to whether the story is true or false or part of a legend. Typically when we think of a "Greek Myth" they are pretty fantastical.

Mythos includes people's overall impression or feeling about something:
- For example, the *American mythos* refers to the people's impressions about the past and the values the founding of America represents in our collective minds. May contain significant truths without being completely or accurately balanced.
- "The pilgrims came to America because they were seeking religious freedom"

# Ex Nihilo Creation
Meaning "out of nothing".
