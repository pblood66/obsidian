# Eurasian Steppe Paradox
- Few places seem less likely to produce great civilizations
- Few places have been as influential on the course of civilization
- Though always sparsely populated, it is in its own way a cradle of humanity 
- What is the explanation?
# Pre-Empire Mongols
- One of the nomadic steppe peoples in East Central Asia
- Had to deal with harsh climate, a short growing season, and few resources
- Only 1% arable land
- Depended on animals for virtually everything: Horse, sheep, goat, yak, camel, some cows
- Required mobility to survive
- As with other steppe peoples, trade - or raiding - and martial skills were essential

# Genghis Khan and the Rise of the Mongol Empire
- Born Temujin, the son of a clan leader in 1162
- Skilled at forging blood brother alliances (*anda*) with various clans
- Eventually unified Mongols through warfare and alliances
- Became "Genghis Khan" (fierce ruler) in 1206
- Engaged in numerous campaigns
- United various groups of Naimans, Tatars and Turks
- Died campaigning in Northwestern China in 1227
# Keys to Success
- Blurred tribal loyalties by integrating army units from various tribes and replacing tribal commanders with those loyal to him personally, in essence creating a new nobility
- Success in battle allowed for distribution of spoils, which kept the army happy
- Terror tactics caused people to submit often without a fight
- Rewarded success and brutally punished disobedience
- Gathered intelligence to know the enemy
- He was fortunate to engage many enemies when they were fighting among themselves or were otherwise disorganized and unprepared to repel the Mongols
# Genghis' Successors
- His son Ogodei became the khagan (khan of khans or great khan)
- Three other sons were khans:
	- Tolui took Mongol homeland
	- Chaghadai took Central Asia
	- Descendants of Jochi took land further west
- The empire was plagued by dynastic struggles after the death of each great khan, and in the next couple of generations
# Pax Mongolica ~1220s to 1360s
- Relative peace
- Mongols encouraged and taxed trade
- They maintained a remarkable postal system
- Trade networks and banking flourished
- Mongol law included strict protections for merchants and trade
- Travelers like Marco Polo brought back inspiring stories of the East
- Luxury goods and new technologies, including paper and gunpowder reached the West
- Trade declined in the mid-14th century with the disintegration of the Mongol khanates, a renewed Chinese isolationism under the Ming dynasty, and the Black Death in the mid-14th century
- Europeans' desire to reopen east-west trade and get luxury goods from the East became he catalyst for the Age of Discovery
# The Four Khanates
