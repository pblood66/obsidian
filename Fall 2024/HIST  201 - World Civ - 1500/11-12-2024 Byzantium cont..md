# New Crisis in the Early 600s 
- Byzantine empire is spread thin after the rule of Justinian in the 500s
- Interior Threats:
	- **Phocas**: A military officer who overthrew the emperor Maurice in the wake of a military rebellion
- Exterior Threats: 
	- **Slavs and Avars** took the Balkans, threatened the north
	- **Persians** conquered Syria, Palestine, and Egypt from 613-619 and put constant pressure on Anatolia
# Heraclius 610-641
- Son of the governor of Africa
- Sailed to Constantinople and deposed Phocas
- Used "holy war" rhetoric, drastic measures, guerrilla war tactics to save the empire
- Retook Syria, Palestine, and Egypt from the Persians
	- Returned "True Cross" to Jerusalem
- Left Persia and Byzantium exhausted
- Enter the **Arabs**: Conquered *weakened* Persian empire and Syria, Palestine, and Egypt in just a couple of decades
# How did Byzantium Survive?
- Focus on modern day Turkey and Greece
- Provinces became "**Themes**" as military districts
	- No more democracy
- Old Roman Aristocracy was replaced by military leaders
- Army adopted new guerrilla tactics allowing for speed, agility, and technology
- Byzantines increasingly saw themselves to preserve Christianity (Holy war mentality) Popular piety increased
- Marked the real end of antiquity
# Byzantine Intellectual Life
- Kept scholarship alive, especially history
	- Because everyone spoke Greek, they were still able to read philosophical works
- Passed Greco-Roman learning on to Arabs, who made many advances and innovations
- The Byzantines were not so creative in science or math as the Arabs but they were good at military technology, mechanical things, and medicine
# Byzantine Economy
- Constantinople was the most cosmopolitan city in the world. 
	- Diverse
- Trade brought foreign merchants and diplomats and merchandise from as far away as China
	- Two Byzantine monks stole Chinese sericulture (silk)
	- Agricultural base: Peasants were the backbone of the army, most Byzantines focused on farming rather than commerce, over-taxation and loss of land forced decline of peasants
	- Jews, Muslims, and by the 1200's Italians (mostly Venetians) dominated Byzantine trade
# Byzantine Politics
- Complicated, entangled, and full of intrigue, assassination, and military revolt
- The politics of the imperial court often spilled over into church affairs
- Unity in the Church was seen as a political imperative. Emperors were not patient with those they viewed as heretics
# Byzantine Private Life
- Private life centered on the *oikos*, the household
- Artisans lived in their shops, the middle class in apartments, aristocrats in mansions
- Many buildings were made of wood. Fire was a problem
- Upper-class houses segregated women: a harem
- Women often wore veils in public
- Marriages were often arranged
- Some empresses were very powerful, but women were mostly relegated to private life and not public affairs
- Byzantine cooking resembled the cooking of other east Mediterranean people, much like the Middle East
# Byzantine Religion
- Unity of Church and State - the emperor appointed the Patriarch - often quite political
- **Monasticism** - Monks and Nuns
- Mysticism, icons
- Missionary work: Converted the Slavs
	- Kievan Rus, Vladimir the Great (880-1015)
- Missionaries developed Cyrillic alphabet in 9th century
# Iconoclast Controversy
- *Iconoclast* - anti-icon
- Wars are fought over it
- Roots
	- Muslim view on images
	- Military losses
	- Volcanic eruption
	- People thought maybe the empire had lost divine favor because of icon use
- Leo III (717-741) and his successors supported removal of images from worship
- Multiple church councils. People were killed over it
- 840s images were back. Icons are very significant in Orthodox Christianity
# Fall of Byzantine Empire
- During the Middle Ages, the empire suffered many losses. The territory became smaller and smaller
- Turks, Mongols, and others threatened Anatolia by 14th Century
- *Ghazi* (raiders) rulers in borderlands including Ottomans
- Mehmet II conquered Constantinople in 1453. Gunpowder and artillery made a major difference
- Ottoman Empire with its capital at Istanbul lasted until 1923
